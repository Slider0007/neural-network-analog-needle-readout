# Training the CNN neural network
Details on setup and training of the CNN neural network

## Software Environment
The training is done using Keras in a python environment. For training purpuses the code is documented in Jupyter notebooks. The environment is setup using Ananconda with Python 3.7[1].

## Network Structure
The network consists of several Conv2D, Maxpooling and Flatten Layers:

It was developed in an empirical way. Never the less serveral tests on the numbers of neuron, number of layers, activation function in combination with different training strategies were investigated. 

These still needs some documentation to be done.
